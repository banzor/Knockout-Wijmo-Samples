Using [Wijmo](http://wijmo.com/widgets/mvvm-support/) with [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/)
================================

Wijmo has full support for MVVM (Model View View-Model) development. We chose Knockout as our officially supported MVVM library. Wijmo has a Knockout Integration Library that provides seamless support for MVVM in every widget. We also included support for all jQueryUI widgets. See some samples now: [InvExplorer](http://demo.componentone.com/Wijmo/InvExplorer/), [Sales Dashboard](http://lsdemo.componentone.com/sales/), [GeoDashboard](http://demo.componentone.com/Wijmo/GeoDashboard/).

These are a few samples on how to use Knockout and the new Knockout Integration Library for Wijmo. You can now declaratively bind wijmo controls.
